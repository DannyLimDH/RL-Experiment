# RL-Experiment

This project contains utilities for generating candidate responses for the Empathetic Dialogues dataset using Hugging Face models. The main script `generate_candidates.py` reads a `train.json` file containing conversation prompts and outputs a list of model generated replies.

## Installation

Install the required libraries with `pip`:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

`generate_candidates.py` also supports progress bars via `tqdm` if it is installed:

```bash
pip install tqdm  # optional
```

## Usage

Run the candidate generation script by providing your dataset file. For example, to process `train.json`:

```bash
python generate_candidates.py train.json
```

This will create `candidate.json` with input/output pairs generated by the chosen model.
